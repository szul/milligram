# Centigram

_A minimalist CSS framework based on [Milligram](https://milligram.io)._

## Why it's awesome

Centigram provides a minimal setup of styles for a fast and clean starting point. It's not a UI framework. It is specially designed for better performance and higher productivity with fewer properties to reset resulting in cleaner code. Originally based on Milligram, Centigram enhances the Milligram base with a more flexible grid system and a handful of composite components.

## Download

**Install with npm**

$ npm install centigram
